            Today there are technologies everywhere. Humans depend upon the
            technologies for almost everything from brushing their teeth to
            using bathrooms. Nowadays almost every human have at least one of
            the many technologies. For an instance, let’s take a daily life
            schedule of an average american man. First thing in the morning, he
            shuts his alarming clock which is one of the analog technology. Then
            he brushes his tooth by an electric toothbrush. And uses his mobile
            phone almost once in every hour. Furthermore, living these daily
            activities behind, we can take banks, hospitals, offices and
            military into account as well. Because these places use great
            technologies for working. Computers are the greatest advancement of
            human kinds. And the history of computer is very long. First
            computer was ENIAC made by John Presper Eckert & John Mauchly. Since
            then computers have been advancing day by day. Later on many
            developers like Charles Babbage developed many computers which have
            been great help since then. Alexander Grahambell who discovered
            telephone and Thomas Alba Edison who discovered light bulb are also
            the discoverers who have played an important role in advancement of
            our kinds.

            <p class="impact">
              <!--Starting of the paragraph-->
              Demand for new and evolving technologies has increased, putting
              more strain on the planet and its natural resources. Various
              numbers of computers and mobile phones are produced regularly. If
              the current epoch continues, our future generation will be
              confronted with several issues. Various health facilities have
              been improved as a result of the widespread use of technology by
              delivering health technologies that either directly or indirectly
              affect human lives. This has a positive impact on developed
              countries, but it harms developing countries because they are
              unable to access the healthcare benefits provided by the
              technology. Population growth in developed countries is controlled
              by a variety of advanced birth control methods that allow for
              population balance in terms of natural resources and other
              benefits associated with planned population. The mindset of
              developing countries, on the other hand, is very different. The
              birth and death rates are both extremely high, but there is a
              scarcity of food and poor health.

              An entire day without technology (or a morning off if you're a
              beginner) allows you to rest, relax, and take in new opportunities
              offline. Take time to read a physical book, make something with
              your hands, garden, or sit and reflect on life before technology
              took over – be grateful that we are old enough to remember life
              before the ubiquitous machine.When driving or taking a walk in the
              woods, put your phone on silent mode. When you're out shopping,
              leave it in your car. Consider what it's like to be a kid again,
              with just a landline and a promise to be somewhere on time – and
              actually turn up? Isn't it freeing not to be tethered to a daily
              reminder that we're still needed right now?
